COMMAND TO RUN:
---------------
#Command to run : python -W ignore Simulator.py config_file <start_date end_date>
#Example1       : python -W ignore Simulator.py test/config_UnleveredRP.cfg
#Example2       : python Simulator.py test/config_AQRIX.cfg 2014-07-01 2014-08-01

To run LeveredRP with futures,credits and currency forwards:
------------------------------------------------------------
    python Simulator.py test/config_AQRIX.cfg

To Print Indicators:
--------------------
    python GenData.py test/config_PrintIndicators.cfg

For correlation calculation
---------------------------------------
    The return series for the config being run will be stored in returns_TargetRiskRP.txt
    COMMAND: python Tools/compute_correlation.py returns1.txt returns2.txt

For Time Profiling
---------------------------------------
    COMMAND: python -m cProfile -s cumulative Simulator.py test/config_AQRIX.cfg

For Debugging(using breakpoints)
--------------------------------
1) python -m pdb Simulator.py path_to_config
2) To add a specific line of a file as breakpoint : b DailyIndicators/StdDev.py:39
3) To move control to next breakpoint : continue
4) To move control to next line : n
5) To show code around the current line : l OR l 5,20
6) To list all breakpoints: b
7) To remove a breakpoint : clear 1          (removes the breakpoint number 1)
8) To start program again : run
9) To print a variable: print var

To calculate performance stats from returns file
------------------------------------------------
    COMMAND: python tools/compute_stats.py /spare/local/logs/config_name/returns.txt

To plot graphs(svg file for graph will be stored in logs/svgs/)
--------------
    COMMAND: python tools/plot_series_interactive.py 0 /spare/local/logs/config_name_1/returns.txt /spare/local/logs/config_name_2/returns.txt /spare/local/logs/config_name_n/returns.txt
    COMMAND: python tools/plot_series_interactive.py 1 /spare/local/logs/config_name_1/weights.txt /spare/local/logs/config_name_2/weights.txt /spare/local/logs/config_name_n/weights.txt
    COMMAND: python tools/plot_series_interactive.py 1 /spare/local/logs/config_name_1/leverage.txt /spare/local/logs/config_name_2/leverage.txt /spare/local/logs/config_name_n/leverage.txt


ASSUMPTIONS/PENDING
-----------
1) It is the users responsibility to ensure that warmupdays parameter in the config file is such that all the indicatos can be calculated after the warmup days
2) Commission Model needs to be changed
3) Symbol of futures contract (only) should be prefixed by 'f' and suffixed by its number '1','2'etc
4) We only trade first futures contract or non futures
5) Cash can be -ve due to cost of trade,levered portfolio and order price being different from fill price
6) All end of day events for a particular date occur simultaneously at 23:59:59:999999
7) Intraday events need to be handled
