COMMAND TO RUN:
---------------
#Command to run : python -W ignore Simulator.py config_file
#Example        : python -W ignore Simulator.py test/config_UnleveredRP.cfg

To run LeveredRP with futures,credits and currency forwards:
------------------------------------------------------------
    python -W ignore Simulator.py test/config_AQRIX.cfg

For correlation calculation
---------------------------------------
    The return series for the config being run will be stored in returns_TargetRiskRP.txt
    COMMAND: python Performance/compute_correlation.py returns1.txt returns2.txt

For Time Profiling
---------------------------------------
    COMMAND: python -m cProfile Simulator.py test/config_AQRIX.cfg


ASSUMPTIONS/PENDING
-----------
1) It is the users responsibility to ensure that warmupdays parameter in the config file is such that all the indicatos can be calculated after the warmup days
2) Commission Model needs to be changed
3) Symbol of futures contract (only) should be prefixed by 'f' and suffixed by its number '1','2'etc
4) We only trade first futures contract or non futures
5) Cash can be -ve due to cost of trade,levered portfolio and order price being different from fill price
6) If there is a futures contract in the symbol list on which the simulation is run,then both first and second futures contract symbols should be specified.
   EG: If 'ES1' is specified then ES2 should also be specified
7) All end of day events for a particular date occur simultaneously at 23:59:59:999999
8) Intraday events need to be handled
